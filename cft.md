Transparency is a means of providing enhanced security to systems by enabling
auditors to hold system providers accountable to agreed-upon compliance
policies.  Cryptographic transparency allows for the auditing of certain
classes of policies in an automated fashion with high assurance.  Systems with
cryptographic transparency have been deployed for a number of applications
including Certificate Transparency for the web PKI, binary transparency for
software supply chains, and key transparency for end-to-end encrypted
messaging applications.  The Workshop on Cryptography Applied to Transparency
Systems (CATS) provides a venue to bring together industry practitioners with
experience building and deploying transparency systems in practice, as well as
researchers on new designs for next-generation transparency systems.

The first iteration of CATS solicits contributions for talk proposals to be
considered for presentation at the workshop.  Topics of interest include (but
are not limited to):

* Design of components in existing transparency systems
* Lessons learned from existing transparency system deployments
* Emerging applications in which transparency systems may be applied
* Authenticated data structures and cryptographic accumulators
* Notions of privacy for transparency systems
* Auditing mechanisms, consensus protocols, and consistency properties of transparency systems
* Proof systems for data lookup and auditing
* Usability considerations for transparency systems
* Measurement studies of transparency systems in practice
* Social and legal implications of transparency systems

## Submission Instructions

Submissions must be in PDF format and must be non-anonymous.
The goal of the submission is to convey to the committee the contents and quality of the proposed talk.
As such, the speaker must be identified and must indicate whether they plan to attend the workshop in person.
We strongly encourage speakers to attend the workshop in-person.
A submission requires a talk abstract, but can in total include:

* A talk abstract (maximum two pages) [REQUIRED]
* Expected presentation slides
* Link to full paper
* Link to past presentations by the speaker or past presentations on the topic

Submissions that violate any of the above rules run the risk of being desk rejected.

Submissions are due by September 1, 2023.
Authors will be notified of decisions by September 29, 2023.
The submission server will be available soon.

## Conflicts of Interest

We will follow the conflict of interest policy as laid out for [ACM CCS 2023](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2023/call-for-paper.html).

## Presentation Format

Contributed talks will be given a 20-minute talk slot at the workshop.
